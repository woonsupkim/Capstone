Smart Patch Bermuda grass seed with mulch and fertilizer is super easy to use. I had an area in my yard where crab grass has started. After removing the crab grass, it left a bare area. I used the Pennington smart patch to fill in the spot. It is easy to apply with just three steps. Loosen the soil, apply the Pennington smart patch and water. According to the manufacturer, you can see the results as soon as one week. I was expecting all the grass seed to germinate at once, but I guess depending on the seeds depth and warmth, it germinates randomly. My patch area has some grass a week old and still new grass sprouting.
