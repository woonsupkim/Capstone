The first time I used these pellet these types of pellets, and play several bowls but that doesnt really work you just have to spread them out like your seeding your yard and then wait. If you know where the slugs or snails are at you can be more generous in those spots but if you dont just spread them out even it throughout the whole yard and then well bring them under control but it will definitely not get rid of them. I would say I got a reduction of around 80% within 2 weeks. I prefer to control it manually the hard way one snail at a time,but when manually doesnt work fast enough, this does a fairly good job.
