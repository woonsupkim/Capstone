As it gets colder, it appears in bulk. This product was very helpful for us to maintain and manage moss growth. Simply pour it out onto the moss-infected area and let it be. I noticed the moss dissipates and growth slows. I let it sit for a week before checking in on it. With two weeks in, I dont see as much moss growth compared to previous weeks. I would recommend this an option to people who want an alternative to managing moss growth besides just scraping away current moss.
