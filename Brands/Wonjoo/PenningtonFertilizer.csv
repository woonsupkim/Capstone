It did the best in the grass where the grass looked healthy but wasnt as full as it could have been. There we could see about 50% improvement even after one use. There was minimal improvement on the patchy parts of the lawn where grass was having trouble growing. I didnt notice any improvement in the spot of our lawn where a big patch of grass has managed to die with no apparent cause, but I cant really blame the product for not working there since we dont know why the grass died, just wanted to mention that it didnt help fix the problem. I didnt notice any improvement on the flowers or smaller plants in our garden with the exception of one plant that has grown taller than we normally see it. The bottle was easy to use and switch between the 3 options. The product in the bottle is yellow so you can easily see that its coming out and mixing with the water. After two uses around the yard and garden we still have enough left for a third treatment and possibly a little more than that. Even though I havent seen great results quickly from this product after using it a couple times I cant for sure say that its entirely the products fault. Maybe it will work better in my area of the world when we arent in the triple digits everyday for weeks. Or maybe it would just work better in climates that dont get this hot at all or ones where it rains on a more frequent basis. For the price I would still recommend it to a family member or friend to at least try since you get a few uses out of it.
