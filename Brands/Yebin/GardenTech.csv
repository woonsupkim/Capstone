My family and I enjoy planting a garden every year. Last year, we spent hours and money planting and tending to our garden. For the first time, we noticed insects were invading. After all of our hard work, we got discouraged , when we had experienced the worst crop ever. My family members wanted to dismiss the idea of working a vegetable and herb garden this year, but I reminded them of all the tasty food that we got from it in the years past, and I convinced them to try it again. The day after we planted the young plants that we got from the local plant nursery, I already noticed that leaves were being eaten and destroyed. While we compost and raise naturally, I could see that we were already fighting a losing battle from the start.. or so I thought. Enter SEVIN. A name that Ive trusted for years to perform. This product kills over 130 insects, so I didnt have to play detective. It also doesnt harm plants! Its designed for use on vegetables, fruits, roses, flowers, shrubs, trees, and other outdoor plants and surfaces. It comes in a convenient ready to use spray bottle, so no mixing is required. It comes ready to use outside around the home. It controls so many pests, including deer ticks!
