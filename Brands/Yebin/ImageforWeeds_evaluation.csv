The actual formula Im not sure is any different than what Ive used in the past. The dispenser is much better and easier to turn on and off. Instead of a knob where I have to awkwardly turn it and Im never sure which way to turn it. This new one is just a slider switch on the top which is extremely convenient and properly labeled so there is no question about which direction to slide it to turn it off/on. The application itself is quite easy. Just attach it to the house, turn it on and start spraying. Im never really sure how much I need to spray for it to have an affect so I just did a light layer around the lawn. It would be nice if it was dyed so I could see where I sprayed and the darkness of the grass tells me how much I sprayed. It was easy enough but one bottle was not enough for my entire lawn. I live on about 0.25 acres so its not very big but I think two bottles would be more than enough. So after the application, the waiting began. It did not happen very quickly and quite honestly, I think its gonna take more time. Some of the weeds have started to turn brown a little bit where they look unhealthy but Im not sure if theyre actually dying or not? Its been about a week now so this stuff works kind of slow. If its anything like the old stuff, itll probably take about 3 weeks. The roundup stuff my neighbor uses seems to work a lot faster.
