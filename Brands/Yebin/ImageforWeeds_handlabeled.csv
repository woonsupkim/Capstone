Image Herbicide Consumer Concentrate Southern Lawn Weed Killer for St. Augustinegrass and Centipedegrass. Its designed to kill dandelion, chickweed, clover, dollarweed and spurge. My lawn has had problems with the first three that I listed. Its concentrated, so its important to thoroughly read the extensive directions. The 32 fl. oz. bottle covers 5000 sq. feet. So heres the most important thing that I learned, if you want to kill the weeds and not damage your lawn, it can only be applied in cooler months when the temperature is no higher than 85 degrees Fahrenheit. I missed the widow of opportunity and decided that getting rid of the weeds would be worth temporarily having done brown grass areas. It works really fast. I noticed weed patches dying by the end of the same day that I applied it. I did have some dead grass due to using it in higher temperatures, but once the weeds were gone, I gently raked those areas and have been giving them extra water, and the green in coming back.
