This product works for the ants around my house, I was getting invaded by ants every year until I started using this product.  It in no way lasts 3 months for me, but we have so many ants its ridiculous,  and I would imagine I would have to hire professional exterminators if I did not apply this every 1-1 months or so. I use it on approximately 1 acre of the property and with a small handheld spreader it takes 4 -24 oz containers to properly treat all the areas infested with ants. Since using this product  I have not had more than 2 small ants come in my home. The disturbingly large 1"" ants still come in, but I dont know how to stop them. I figure they will soon be large enough to simply open my door and let themselves in! But this really is a great product if you have any ant infestations,  or even ant hills littering your yard.
