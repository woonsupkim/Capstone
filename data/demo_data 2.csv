However, at this time, there are NO instructions for how to use the new nozzle anywhere online or on the bottle/label. The nozzle options are now: OFF, RINSE, & CLEAN. It was a bit frustrating trying to figure it out and I had to call their customer service, who ended up being really nice. They said to toggle it to CLEAN to use the solution; RINSE will just be water.If youve sprayed down your entire garden and it doesnt look like its pulling any solution, then the internal tube might be clogged. Make sure to shake vigorously before using/if it seems clogged. If that doesnt work, you can try to open the bottle and manually unclog it. Be careful not to break it getting it open since it might be a little tricky. Once I figured out the nozzle, it worked great. I did not have any breaking parts or leaking issues. Ive been dealing with a bad Japanese beetle infestation eating my rose bushes, but most of the beetles were  either dead or had flown away to harass another yard by the next morning.
